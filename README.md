# Collate - Record Aggregation Application

### Our app aggregates records from multiple stores, allowing users to view, filter, and add them to their cart for efficient purchase. Users can find the cheapest option, including price and shipping, from a handful of independent records.


## User Stories

* As a user, I want a grid page containing all record listings, so that I can view all products on the site.

* As a user, I want a filter and sort function on the grid page, so that I can specify my search results.

  * Filter sort function should include price, genre, label, artist, and record store, as well as stock levels such as Low stock, Sold out, Pre-order, and In stock. Sort by cheapest delivery, cheapest retailer, release date, etc

* As a user, I want a landing page that displays various site options and listings, so that I can be made aware of new releases, blog posts and more.

* As a user, I want an add button on each grid item I.e. record, so that I can add to a cart/holding page.

* As a user, I want a cart, so that when a user clicks the add button when on the grid page the record selected is stored in a cart for the user to view.

* As a user, I want the cart to display two tabs, one tab for listing the records selected and the other for storing the available merchants/pricing and delivery options for each individual record.

* As a user, I need the option to create an account, so that I can store my current cart selections.

* As a user, I want a profile settings page, so that I can view, amend and delete my profile or account with the site. 

* As a user, I want a profile page that displays my likes and comments, possibly my purchases, so that I can keep track of such things.


## Tech Stack

We need to decide which scraping method/technology is most efficient. Additionally, the MERN stack choice may change, and we might opt for DJANGO and PostGreSQL. We may also incorporate other third-party APIs, and we will document them accordingly.
